## Overview 
This was the most fun module thus far. The process went from conceptualizing the data tables and how they connected with diagrams in QuickDBD to importing the .csv data sets into dataframes that I constructed in pgAdmin. 

## Tools
- PostgreSQL 11.14 (has been debugged the most) without Stack Builder for tables and their predefined relationships

- pgAdmin to write and execute quer

## Deliverable 1: The number of retiring employees by title
I'll create a table for Retirement Titles that utilizes the the ERD (entity relationship diagram) I created earlier in this module. Because some employees have multiple titles due to promotions, I'll need to use the 'DISTINCT ON' statement and 'COUNT()' function. 

## Deliverable 2: The employees elligible for the mentorship program
I'll again use the ERD and queries to create a mentorship eligibility table by organizing primary keys, foreign keys and the data types. 

## Deliverable 3: Written report on employee database analysis
